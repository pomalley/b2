# B2

This is a replacement for the [first books app](https://github.com/pomalley/books) (hence the name).

It uses a Firebase backend to store the data, and polymer to do all of the computation locally. Still very much a work in progress.

This began as the polymer starter kit template.

Now going to change away from polymer.
